theory: Charlie is feeling cold -- he is also feeling quite rough, red, nice and round. Fred seems to be round. A bit overweight, Gary is big and round. He's a nice guy who is often cold. Folks who are rough and tumble yet gentle and kind are blue. A rather big person is a red person. A kind person will certainly be rough as well. Anyone having rough, cold and green qualities will also have a big quality. People who are young and blue are also red. People who are said to be big and nice are round. Cold and red people are always kind to others.

From the theory, we can deduce the following:

- Cold and red people are always kind.
